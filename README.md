# Aesthetic-ID

# What?
Aesthetic ID is a project that utilizes the Microsoft Cognitive Emotion API to help detect emotions of an image a user submits.  This will also provide the user with sensory details of the aesthetic of vaporwave as well as provide various text and music selection for the user.

# Who wrote Aesthetic-ID?
It is authored by Matt Hallowell and Craig Bruenger, who both collaberated to bring Aesthetic-ID to life.

# When?
Between January 14-15 at Uncommon Hacks @ Chicago, Illinois.

# Why?
A e s t h e t i c s, as well as the challenge of learning a foreign artificial intelligence API.

# What were your challenges?
Working with the Microsoft API was a challenge to implement using Javascript, and we were able to overcome this issue after dilligently searching through the code and by asking others for input.

# What Languages does Aesthetic-ID currently implement?
HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery(API Request)

# How do you operate Aesthetic-ID?
As of the latest commit, this will only function locally, which will require your own Microsoft Ocp Key from Microsoft.  In addition, you will need to change the url within the data attribute to send the photo through the cognitive API to detect the emotion.

# What is the future for Aesthetic-ID?
To be determined.
