# Aesthetic-ID

# What?
Aesthetic ID is a project that utilizes the Microsoft Cognitive Emotion API to help detect emotions of an image a user submits.  This will also provide the user with sensory details of the aesthetic of vaporwave as well as provide various text and music selection for the user.

# Who wrote Aesthetic-ID?
It is authored by Matt Hallowell and Craig Bruenger, who both collaberated to bring Aesthetic-ID to life.

# When?
Between January 14-15 at Uncommon Hacks @ Chicago, Illinois.

# Why?
A e s t h e t i c s, as well as the challenge of learning a foreign artificial intelligence API and try to make it into a deployable web application.

# What were your challenges?
Working with the Microsoft API was a challenge to implement using Javascript, and we were able to overcome this issue after dilligently searching through the code and by asking others for input.

Working with pictures that had multiple faces present and performing calculations on them.

Getting the Javascript and our webpage to cooperate was another challenge, as the design of the webframeworks and styling clashed.

Trying to get a form that would parse the url for facial detection was difficult and we did not have enough time to solve that problem.  We assume it was something within the Javascript parsing of information that ended up breaking and not being operational.

Merging the working files that we both worked on proved a challenge, as the integration of our work took time to complete, and is still not necessarily complete.

# What Languages does Aesthetic-ID currently implement?
HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery(API Requests)

# How do you operate Aesthetic-ID?
As of the latest commit, this will only function locally, which will require a new Microsoft Cognitive software key every 24 hrs.  At the the conclusion of this event we only had enough time to have it run on a fixed link in the background, but in the future there will be an implementation to have any user submitted url get processed.

# What are you proud of?
That we were able to access and understand the Microsoft Facial Recognition/Emotion API and implement it into a situation where it would work!

In addition, we were able to make our application detect all of the emotional statusus of people in a photo (we tested up to 19 people in a single photo and it worked!)

In addition we really like the current a e s t h e t i c.

# What is the future for Aesthetic-ID?
Make the form box and button functional.
Create a fix for the changing subscription access from Microsoft Services (it changes every 24hrs).
Create a better display for output, a new .html page, rather than Javascript alerts.
Improve the HTML/CSS code to reduce redundacy as well as make more stylish.
Deploy the website on the web.
Create an organized file hierachy.
